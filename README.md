# quarkus-app

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it's not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Deploying to AWS App Runner

1. **Build the Quarkus application:**
   ```shell
   ./mvnw package
   ```
2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```shell
   docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/quarkus-app:latest -f Dockerfile .
   ```
3. **Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR):**
   ```shell
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/quarkus-app:latest
   ```
4. **Create an AWS App Runner service:**
   - In the AWS Console, go to App Runner.
   - Create a new service from your container registry and select the image you pushed.
   - Set the port to 8080.
   - Deploy the service.

Your Quarkus app will be available at the URL provided by App Runner.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
